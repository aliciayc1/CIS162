<p class="left">Hello, my name is Alicia Chen! I am a rising sophomore in Whitney High School and I have had a passion for computer science since I was little. In addition to coding, I have an affinity for art, and I like to doodle whenever I am able to. I also am a very people-oriented person, so talking to others is something I love to do. Other hobbies of mine include reading, writing, and playing with my pet cat, Hanzel. Overall, I hope this class will give me more skills that I can put to use in the computer science field!</p>
